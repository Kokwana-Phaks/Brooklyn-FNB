#Exception handling in Python allows you to gracefully handle errors and unexpected situations in your code. Here's a comprehensive overview:

'''
try:
    print(x)
except:
    print("An exception occured")
    
'''

try:
    print(x)
except NameError:
    print("Variable x is not defined")
except:
    print("An exception occurred")
finally:
    print("The 'try except' is finished")
